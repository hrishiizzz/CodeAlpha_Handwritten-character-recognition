This project focuses on Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) using deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify handwritten characters from images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained on diverse datasets to recognize various scripts and styles, enabling applications in digitizing handwritten documents, automating data entry, and enhancing accessibility. The system aims to improve accuracy and efficiency in recognizing handwritten text, making it a valuable tool for educational and professional settings.
